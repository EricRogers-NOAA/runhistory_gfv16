# This script will tar up the directory specified by the first
# argument ($1) and place the tar file on the HPSS server
# under ${HPSSOUT}.  The tar file is put in the directory
# appropriate for data valid for the day specified as the second 
# command line argument ($2).
# The third argument, if present, indicates whether the tar file 
# should be written to the 1-year, 2-year, or permanent archive.
# Valid values for the 3rd argument are "1", "2" or "perm"
#
# Usage: aqm_rhist_savedir.sh Directory Date(YYYYMM format) [1|2|perm]
#
# Where: Directory  = Directory to be tarred.
