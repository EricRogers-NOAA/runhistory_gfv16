In the next run_history upgrade -p1/p2 transition to dell
We will remove the JRHIST_AQM_EMISSION job (and exrunhist_aqm_emission.sh.ecf)
and merge the aqm_emission archive to the same JRHIST job, just create a ush script for aqm_emission

Integration of aqm_emission archiving into JRHIST did not happen as of v2.3.0. The main update needed will be for scripts/exrhist.sh.ecf to have some logic accomodating the 12z cycle wanted by aqm_emission (or for the transfer to happen at a different time?)

HMON and HWRF ush scripts could easily be consolidated.
